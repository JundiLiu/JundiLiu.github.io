While the federal regulatory agency has instituted a compliance review-based rating method to encourage carriers to improve their safety levels, concerns have been expressed regarding the effectiveness of the current ratings. In this paper, we consider a crash rate level (high, medium, and low) rather than a compliance review-based rating (satisfactory, conditional satisfactory, and unsatisfactory). We demonstrate an automated way of predicting the crash rate levels for each carrier using three different classification models (Artificial Neural Network, Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Support Vector Machine) and three separate variable selection methods (Empirical Evidence, Multiple Factor Analysis, Garson's algorithm). The predicted crash rate levels (high, low) are compared to the assigned levels based on the current safety rating method. The results indicate the feasibility of crash rate level as an effective measure of carrier safety, with CART having the best performance.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Interstate Motor Carrier Crash Rate Level using Classification Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**J.

For the OEMs, majority of downstream operations are sequential, requiring the availabilities of all the parts on time to ensure successful executions of production schedules. Therefore, accurate prediction of the delivery times of purchase orders (POs) is critical to satisfying these requirements. However, such prediction is challenging due to the suppliers’ distributed locations, time-varying capabilities and capacities, and unexpected changes in raw materials procurements. We address some of these challenges by developing supervised machine learning models in the form of Random Forests and Quantile Regression Forests that are trained on historical PO transactional data. Further, given the fact that many predictors are categorical variables, we apply a dimension reduction method to identify the most influential category levels. Results on real-world OEM data show effective performance with substantially lower prediction errors than supplier-provided delivery time estimates.","tags":[],"title":"Predicting Purchase Orders Delivery Times using Regression Models with Dimension Reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

Supply–demand networks form the backbones of both services and manufacturing industries, and need to operate as efficiently as possible to yield optimized returns. In this letter, we bring the notion of multiagent systems to clustered supply–demand networks such that each supplier acts as an agent. Consequently, we adapt consensus-based auction bidding methods to optimize the assignment of demands to the suppliers with known communication pathways and resource constraints. Results on moderately large networks show promising performance in terms of both assignment quality, as given by the overall demand delivery cost and proportion of assigned demands, and computation time","tags":[],"title":"Auction Bidding Methods for Multi-Agent Consensus Optimization in Supply-Demand Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**J.

The primary technical reason for this problem is that information flows across supply chains are limited, making it difficult to have satisfactory predictive capabilities on critical decision making considerations such as on-time parts deliveries and production demand forecasts. Consequently, the specific objective of this project is to leverage the power of supervised machine learning in utilizing historical transactional data to provide real-time information into the predicted flow of parts or materials across supply chain systems for both OEMs and SMEs.","tags":["DMDII"],"title":"Enabling Real-Time Supply Chain Visibility Through Predictive Analytics","type":"project"}]
