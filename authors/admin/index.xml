      <description>I am a PhD student in Industrial &amp;amp; Systems Engineering Department at University of Washington. I am co-advised by Prof. Linda Boyle who leads Human Factors and Statistical Modeling (HFSM) Lab and Prof. Ashis Banerjee who leads Scale-independent Multimodal Automated Real Time Systems (SMARTS) Lab. Prior to studying at UW, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m working on Synergy: Augmented reality for control of reservation-based intersections with mixed autonomous-non autonomous flows funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).</description>
